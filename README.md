wsdl_generator
==============

This script will generate WSDL 1.1 service containing all tags needed, you just have to propertly fill all generated types with fields required by your service.

It is very useful when you designing new system and need to create a lot of WSDLs. You may just generate them with this script, and then complete them manually or import them into an application like Enterprise Architect.
Generated WSDL will contain one service with as much operations as you specify in command line.
All operations are request-reply wrapped document/literal.
